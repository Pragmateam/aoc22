# Pragmateam solves AoC 22 🎅

[Advent of Code][aoc] is a series of small programming puzzles released in the road to christmas as an advent calendar.

[aoc]: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

These are the solutions from Pragmateam team members participating in the 2022 edition. We use a varity of languages and methods and try the puzzles to strenghten our skills in TDD, problem solving and software design, but more importantly to have some fun!

# How To 🎄

Create a directory with your name and add your solutions under it. The solutions for each day go under their own directory:

```
├── <your name here>
│   ├── 1
│   ├── 2
│   ├── 3
│   └── 4
└── README.md
```

Since we all use different tools, there's no required structure to what you add to the folders for each day. Do what works for your language, tools and process.

Happy December!
